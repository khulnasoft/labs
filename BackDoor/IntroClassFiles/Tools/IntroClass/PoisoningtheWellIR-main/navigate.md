# Poisoning the Well - Incident Response Labs

In this lab, we will navigate through log files that simulate an attack on a corporate domain. Our goal is to illustrate how to investigate attack logs. Detecting initial intrusion to Domain Admin, we are going to explore the techniques used by threat actors and how we can detect a breach. This walkthrough utilizes [MERlin](https://github.com/her3ticAVI/MERlin/tree/main), [Sysmon](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon), [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/), and any text editor to conduct our investigation.
